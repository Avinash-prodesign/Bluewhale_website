                <p>
                    Predictive analytics refers to using historical data, machine learning, and artificial 
                    intelligence to predict what will happen in the future. This historical data is fed into
                    a mathematical model that considers key trends and patterns in the data. The model is 
                    then applied to current data to predict what will happen next.
